# File-Operations-
##File-Operations-in-Python-
This program reads a text file, processes its content, and writes the results to a new file. It also counts the number of words in the file.
The file is called input.txt and the Python script converts all text to uppercase, writes the processed text and the word count to a new file called output.txt. It then prints a success message once the new file is created.
